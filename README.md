# Importance of the application:

During this time where everybody is stuck in their homes with the total number of cases crossing 6M in India, there is a hope for good news soon with a lot of vaccine trials reaching its last stages of human testing.
After a vaccine passes its human testing, the government has to deal with providing vaccination to each citizen of the country in an organized manner. This application will help each citizen go to the hospital closest to their location where he/she will be able to get the vaccination on their booked day. A counter will be built in to prevent more than 50 people from choosing the same hospital on the same day. 

We have used the Google Maps Places API to fetch the location of Hospitals based on the geolocation of the user.

[Make sure to replace all API_KEY with personal AOI_KEY generated from Google Maps Platform]

## Results : 
Order and systematic method to get the vaccination done following COVID-19 rules. In difficult times knowing the exact amount of vaccien to be bought will benefit hospitals to spend the correct amount of its resources on vaccine.
