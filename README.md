The aim of this App is to ease the process of distribution of vaccination of the COVID-19 virus once the vaccination is produced and is ready for the people.
implementation : We have made an App that allows users to sign in/ Log in and select a date when they would prefer to take the vaccination.<br>
Based on the data a hospital close to their location is allocated to them.

Once the person chooses which day he/she prefers that day is assigned to them. The app also show number of days left for their vaccination day.

# Importance of the App 
During this time where everybody is stuck in their homes with the total number of cases crossing 6M in India, there is a hope for good news soon with a lot of vaccine trials reaching its last stages of human testing.<br>
After a vaccine passes its human testing, the government has to deal with providing vaccination to each citizen of the country in an organised manner.<br>
This application will help each citizen go to the hospital closest to their location where he/she will be able to get the vaccination on their booked day.

# Results
Order and systematic method to get the vaccination done following COVID-19 rules.<br>
In difficult times knowing the exact amount of vaccine to be bought will benefit hospitals to spend the correct amount of its resources on vaccines.
